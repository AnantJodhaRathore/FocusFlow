## Scientific foundation

FocusFlow is grounded in peer-reviewed research:

- **Digital Eye Strain (DES)** — Mark Rosenfield, SUNY College of Optometry,
  research on computer vision syndrome
- **20-20-20 rule** — Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds
- **Ergonomic computing** — workspace and posture guidelines for screen-intensive work
- **Cognitive fatigue research** — Human-Computer Interaction studies on attention and recovery

---

## Core principle

> Assist silently, never interrupt aggressively.

FocusFlow is calm, lightweight, and privacy-focused.
All data is stored locally on-device until the user opts into cloud sync in Phase 5.
